#### Outcome variables


#### Predictor: dummy variable of homeroom teacher status in school year 2013-14


#### Covariates

I inspect the major characteristics of these schools, teachers, students, and their parents in base-year data and use these characteristics as control variables or covariates in my analysis since they can be considered as pre-existing to wave 2 outcomes.
